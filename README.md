 Being a landlord entails a lot of hard work. Hard work that comes with stress and headache. 
 Some of the numerous problems landlords face include: 
 screening for reliable tenants or buyers of their property, 
 following up legal and tax procedure, 
 accounting and financial management, 
 collecting rent, doing maintenance, to name a few. 
 To reduce this stress on the part of the landlord it is always good to contact a real estate agent. 
 On the other hand, tenants of real estate also go through the stress of finding a house to rent, paying the rent, keeping in touch with their landlord. 
 As the world becomes more and more virtual, the need for virtual marketplaces increases as well. 
 What if one could advertise one’s real estate in a virtual marketplace? 
 Or, what if one could just navigate to a web page to find all houses  that are for sale or rent  around one’s location?
